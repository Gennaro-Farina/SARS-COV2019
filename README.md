# Implementation of a SIR model for the predictions of coronavirus spreads
This repo will contain:

1) data preprocess and cleaning
2) the code for a dynamical model for the evolution of the pandemy
3) a numerical integrator of the dynamical equations for the SIR model
4) prediction up to septmeber 2020
5) containment measures:

   - a model that take into account quarantine measures

   - a cost function which could represent the economic cost for institutions to enforcing quarantine measures and the economic cost per infected person

   - optimal strategies to minimize the total economic cost of the epidemic.


# SARS-COV2019

In 2020 our world met a disastrous pandemic known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
A subset of the people who get infected unfortunately have some severe respiratory phenomenae. 
The COVID-19 disease in fact is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Former episodes was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019.
